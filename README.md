This is the code used to run [Nick Such's Personal Dashboard](http://nicksuch.com/nick/dashboard/), a Quantified Self side project.

It makes heavy use of Google Docs as a data store. That's convenient for some scenarios, but not very scalable. It should be changed :)

You'll need your own Google Spreadsheet similar to [mine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Atv7Kh0l7ItmdEZkcmg5M2l5WjE0VVU0RHFDNXZrS1E&hl=en_US#gid=5) in order to run this code without significant refactoring.

A more in-depth explanation of the goals of this project is on my [blog](http://nicksuch.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/adventures-in-self-tracking-my-quest-to-export-data-from-myfitnesspal-quantifiedself/).
